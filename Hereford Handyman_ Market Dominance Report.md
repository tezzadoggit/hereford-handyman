## 1. The 'Invisible' B2B List & Outreach Strategy

Our B2B strategy focuses on targeting businesses with high "maintenance anxiety"—those for whom a broken fixture directly impacts revenue or compliance, yet are too small to employ a full-time facilities manager. These businesses represent a high-volume, recurring revenue stream.

### High-Volume B2B Target Categories in Hereford

| Business Category | Rationale | Key Pain Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Independent Letting Agencies** (50-200 Listings) | These agencies manage a significant number of properties and require a reliable, systemized approach to maintenance to keep tenants happy and properties in good condition. They are often let down by unreliable sole traders. | Unreliable tradespeople, inconsistent quality, lack of transparent pricing, administrative overhead of managing multiple invoices. |
| **Private Landlords of HMOs** (Houses in Multiple Occupation) | HMOs experience high wear and tear due to multiple tenants, necessitating quick turnaround times for repairs to ensure rooms remain lettable and profitable. | Need for rapid response to minimize vacancy periods, difficulty finding tradespeople for smaller jobs, compliance with safety regulations. |
| **Independent Care Homes & Supported Living** | These facilities, particularly smaller ones in areas like Tupsley and Whitecross, operate under strict compliance and safety regulations. They require DBS-checked, professional, and punctual maintenance services. | Ensuring compliance with care standards, need for trustworthy and vetted tradespeople, minimizing disruption to residents. |
| **AirBnB / Holiday Let Management Companies** | As a gateway to the Wye Valley, Hereford has a growing short-term rental market. Guest satisfaction is paramount, and a broken shower or faulty appliance can lead to negative reviews and lost income. | Speed of repair is critical to guest experience, need for a service that can be booked and managed remotely, maintaining high property standards. |

### The 'Retainer' Cold Email Script

This email script is designed to be sent to property managers and owners of the target businesses identified above. It directly addresses their pain points and introduces the 'Priority Retainer Package' as the solution.
